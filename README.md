# Vet_Nurse

This is a Java mobile application that I created to help the nurses at my veterinary job. It contains a few pages of quick resources for important calculations and knowledge.
The H202 page is a quick reference to induce vomiting if a canine patient has ingested a toxic substance. The dog's weight in pounds is entered into the application and
it will inform the nurse how much H202 to instruct the client to give to the dog to induce vomiting. There is also a common medications dosage page. It contains over the counter
medications that nurses commonly recommend to clients for issues like vomiting or allergies. The nurse enters the weight of the dog and chooses the medication from a spinner.
Upon clicking the calculate button, the recommended dosage is displayed. Another feature of this application is a chocolate toxicity calculator. Clients commonly call to 
report that their dog has ingested chocolate and the nurse needs to be able to determine if the amount of chocolate is toxic. The dog's weight is entered, along with the amount of 
chocolate ingested. The type of chocolate is chosen from a spinner. The application then informs the nurse how toxic the chocolate is and a recommended action. New pages will be added to this
application soon.
